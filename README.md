## Overview
This is my portfolio showcasing some of my projects. For a working live demo see: https://andycarlsson.github.io/portfolio/#/.

### Project goals
My aim with this project was first and foremost to create my own little space on the internet, somewhere to show off what side projects I have done.
I also saw this project as a great way to learn more about ReactJS and when I encountered StyledComponents also learn more about that way of writing styling for React components.

## Technologies
- ReactJS
- StyledComponents
